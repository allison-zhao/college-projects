# Minion Factory (or Minion Rush) - a first try at tile games

During Fall 2015, my friends and I collaborated to build this tile game as a midterm project for our Interactive Computing class. We had a huge amount of fun and nostalgia in the process (s/o to the generation that grew up with Super Mario Bros.!). Feel free to check out the [documentation file](minion-factory-documentation.pdf) for more details on how we built this game from scratch.

Due to copyright and licensing reasons, I will not be able to upload the artwork and background music as they were downloaded from Google and were only used for educational purposes. However, you can check out the quick demo GIFs and a demo video linked below from my Google Drive :)

## Quick Demo

Start screen and Level 1 (Collect all keys to save [Agnes](http://despicableme.wikia.com/wiki/Agnes_Gru)!)

Level 2 (Avoid little monsters and collect enough falling bananas to meet the Banana King!)

To watch a quick version of the game play, here is the [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByGiBFdaFyMoMTV5Q1lSaEY0aG8/view?usp=sharing) on my Google Drive.

Enjoy!
